        <p>Dear Centerling,</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for applying to <strong><a href="https://hacks.cdtm.com/">CDTM Hacks 2025</a></strong> and for your enthusiasm in contributing to our hackathon community.</p>

        <p>We received an overwhelming number of exceptional applications, which made the selection process incredibly competitive. Unfortunately, weâ€™re unable to offer you a participant spot this time.</p>

        <p>This decision was not easy and does not reflect your potential or motivation. Due to space and team-size limitations, we had to make some very difficult choices.</p>

        <p>However, we'd love for you to still be part of the event - as a <strong>volunteer</strong>! ðŸŽ‰ Volunteers play a key role in making the hackathon experience amazing for everyone. It's a great way to stay involved, meet participants, and be part of the atmosphere.</p>

        <p>If you're interested, you can sign up using this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/J1CKYViXSDS5qJA99">Volunteer Sign-Up Form</a>.</p>

        <p>Thanks again for your support - we're lucky to have such an engaged CDTM community behind this event.</p>

        <p>Warm regards,</p>

        <p><strong>The CDTM Hacks Team</strong></p>
