        <p>Dear Applicant,</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for applying to <strong><a href="https://hacks.cdtm.com/">CDTM Hacks 2025</a></strong> and for your interest in being part of our hackathon community.</p>

        <p>We received an overwhelming number of outstanding applications, which made the selection process incredibly tough. Unfortunately, we're unable to offer you a spot this time.</p>

        <p>This decision is not a reflection of your potential or ideas, we simply had limited capacity and had to make some difficult choices while screening.</p>

        <p>That said, this doesn't have to be the end of your journey with CDTM!</p>

        <p>ðŸ“Œ <strong>The application for the CDTM is currently open</strong>â€”if you're curious about entrepreneurship, interdisciplinary collaboration and research, we highly encourage you to apply. You can find more information on our <a href="https://cdtm.com/">website</a>.</p>

        <p>Also, we're hosting several other events in the coming weeks that you might find interesting. Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/cdtm-munich">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/centerlings/">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://lu.ma/user/usr-155pp5bEZxqeQBp">Luma</a> to hear about upcoming opportunities.</p>

        <p>Wishing you all the best in your projects and future hackathons!</p>

        <p>Best regards,</p>
