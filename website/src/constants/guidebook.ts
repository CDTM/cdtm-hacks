<strong>avi</strong>

<i>Introduction:</i> Receiving a patient for the first time in a clinic requires significant time and effort from medical staff and can often be a scattered, chaotic, and overwhelming experience for patients. As a result, critical patient information is often collected incompletely or inconsistently.

For clinicians to treat patients holistically, they need a structured, accessible, and comprehensive view of the patient's medical background ‚Äî including insurance information, basic measurements (e.g., height, weight), lifestyle, family history, chronic conditions, prior lab results, wearable health data, medication plans, vaccination certificates, and more.

Your goal is to, on the one hand, transform the patient intake experience: make it fast, simple and all-encompassing. On the other hand, empower medical staff with a clear, compact, actionable and 'full picture' to treat them better and faster.
